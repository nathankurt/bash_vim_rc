# bash_vim_rc

## .bashrc
This has mainly been used for the Windows linux subsystem and works a little bit better there since there are some hacky formatting things i had to use to get things to work

## .vimrc
This is used on both Mac and WSL and works for both. 

### Dependencies
This needs [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) to run any of the plugins go and download this firs

## .zshrc
Using this mainly for mac, but will try to get it working on WSL also. 

### Dependencies
This has a few that I can't remember off the top of my head but will update when I get around to it
